# CGD-stata-scheme
A Stata scheme for CGD graphs

This is a scheme to implement CGD's [branding and data viz guidelines](https://centerforglobaldevelop.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/fileshare/Shared%20Documents/NDrive/Communications/CGD%20Branding%20Materials/CGD-Data-Viz-Style-Guide.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=H081DY) on Stata graphs. There are other versions of this script floating around, but the point of this repository is to serve as the canonical version. If you have a change or improvement to the script (very welcome!) please submit a pull request, if you have your own Github account or contact Jeremy Gaines (jgaines@cgdev.org) to get the direct login info.

*The ggplot2 version of this script is available [here](https://github.com/cgdevDC/CGD-R-theme/).*
